# CS2 ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)

## Overview
This project is a CS2 ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) tool designed to enhance gameplay by providing players with visual aids to spot enemies and other game elements. 

## Features
- ESP for enemy players
- Bounding box around players
- Health and weapon information display
- Always Up-To-Date offsets
- Skulls drawn to player heads
- Displays the distance to other players

## Troubleshooting
- If the offsets are not working or returning an error then [create an issue](https://github.com/Nitrous-0xide/cs2-esp/issues).
- If the esp is not rendering try making sure your game is in windowed or windowed fullscreen
- To manually update offsets use the amazing [dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/releases/tag/0.1.2) made by [a2x](https://github.com/a2x/)
